# Frontend Notes

## Avatar components

They are a copy of [Boring Avatars](https://github.com/boringdesigners/boring-avatars) but with types,
so they probably do things that should be reworked for TS.

## Styling components

Use [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com) for this. Remember to use the correct CSS
variables when using colors and such.
